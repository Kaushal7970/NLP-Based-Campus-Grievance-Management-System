# NLP Based Campus-Grievance-Management-System

The Campus Grievance Management System is a web-based application designed to help students raise
complaints safely and help institutions resolve them in a structured and transparent way. The system
replaces informal methods like verbal complaints, WhatsApp messages, and emails with a proper digital
platform that ensures accountability, tracking, and student safety.
